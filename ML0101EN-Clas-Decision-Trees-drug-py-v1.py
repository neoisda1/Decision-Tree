# <h1><center>Decision Trees</center></h1>

# In this lab exercise, you will learn a popular machine learning algorithm, Decision Tree. You will use this classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then you use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.

#     <h2>About the dataset</h2>
#     Imagine that you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y. 
#     <br>
#     <br>
#     Part of your job is to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. The feature sets of this dataset are Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol of patients, and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.
#     <br>
#     <br>
#     It is a sample of binary classifier, and you can use the training part of the dataset 
#     to build a decision tree, and then use it to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to prescribe it to a new patient.

# The <b>X</b> and <b>y</b> are the arrays required before the split, the <b>test_size</b> represents the ratio of the testing dataset, and the <b>random_state</b> ensures that we obtain the same splits.

# 
# In multilabel classification, the function returns the subset accuracy. If the entire set of predicted labels for a sample strictly match with the true set of labels, then the subset accuracy is 1.0; otherwise it is 0.0.

# ## Practice 
# Can you calculate the accuracy score without sklearn ?
